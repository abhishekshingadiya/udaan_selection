  use hoverable images as event photos.
  you can use a background image and create an attractive look.
  you can see fixed button's list icons are pulsing.
  I am on event page so event page's icon not pulsing.


# eventdetails.html
  hear I am using a materialized cards with tabs in event details card you can insert image or text both.
  here one more thing I add small handlebar script example.
  using data.js and head.js print heads name.


# info.html
  using materialized card with a gif.
  a gif is better than simple image because gif makes look attractive.
  if I touch info icon when I am on icon page so icon page is not refreshing but just simple pass one toast.


# heads.handlebars
  store template for print head data in .handlebars format.


# heads.js
  create js file using heads.handlebars


# data.js
  save data in JSON format and print on event details page.
